Automating AWS using BOTO3
Automating using Boto3

 Prerequisites:
1. AWS Account: Ensure you have an AWS account.
2. AWS CLI: Install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine.

 Steps:

 1. Set Up MongoDB:
   - Launch a MongoDB instance on an EC2 instance or use an external MongoDB service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
Or
Use atlas

 2. Develop and Test MERN Application Locally:
   - Develop your MERN application. [TravelMemory]
   - Test it locally to ensure it works as expected.

 3. Configure AWS EC2 Instances:
   - Launch EC2 instances for your Node.js server and React.js client.
   - Install Node.js and other required dependencies on the server instance.
- Deploy your MERN application to the EC2 instances manually.
   - Ensure the instances register with the ELB.

 4. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):
   - Create a Classic Load Balancer or an Application Load Balancer in the AWS Management Console.
   - Configure listeners and target groups.

 5. Auto Scaling Group (ASG):
   - Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to manage EC2 instances for your application.
   - Configure the launch configuration with your AMI (Amazon Machine Image).

 6. CloudWatch Alarms:
   - Set up CloudWatch Alarms to monitor key metrics like CPU utilization, and configure actions to trigger based on alarm states.

 7. Lambda Functions:
   - Create Lambda functions for specific tasks, such as periodic tasks or automation.
   - Set up triggers for Lambda functions, such as CloudWatch Events.
 - Eg. Automatic backup of mongodb â†’ pymongo, mongoexport

 8. Simple Notification Service (SNS):
   - Create an SNS topic for sending notifications.
   - Subscribe relevant services (e.g., email, SMS) to the SNS topic.
   - Configure CloudWatch Alarms to send notifications through SNS.


 9. Monitor and Scale:
   - Monitor your application's performance through CloudWatch.
   - Use ASG to automatically scale based on defined policies.

 10. Test and Troubleshoot:
   - Test your deployed application.
   - Monitor logs, metrics, and troubleshoot any issues.

 Additional Considerations:
- Security:
  - Configure security groups and network ACLs.
  - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for fine-grained access control.

- Domain and SSL:
  - Consider setting up a custom domain using Route 53.
  - Enable SSL using ACM (AWS Certificate Manager).

- Backup and Recovery:
  - Implement backup strategies for your database.
  - Plan for recovery in case of failures.
